  <h1>Phase 1 — Ground Truth Mapping</h1>
  <p>
    In this phase the existing U.S. debt system is mapped mechanically.  Stocks
    are distinguished from flows, nominal values from real, and domestic
    holders from external holders.  The goal is to establish invariant facts
    independent of ideology.
  </p>
  <h2>Stocks versus Flows</h2>
  <p>
    The federal debt is a stock representing accumulated past deficits.  As of
    December 22 2025, publicly held debt was approximately <strong>\$30.8 trillion</strong>,
    intragovernmental holdings (mainly trust funds) were <strong>\$7.6 trillion</strong>
    and total gross debt was about <strong>\$38.4 trillion</strong>【589265682130222†L0-L3】.  By
    contrast, the fiscal year 2025 deficit—an annual flow—was projected at
    about <strong>\$1.8 trillion</strong>【427621672574965†L74-L96】.
  </p>
  <h2>Nominal versus Real</h2>
  <p>
    Debt figures are reported in nominal dollars.  Real measures adjust for
    inflation and are critical for understanding sustainability.  A rising
    nominal debt can coexist with a falling debt‑to‑GDP ratio if real GDP
    growth or inflation outpaces debt accumulation.
  </p>
  <h2>Domestic versus External Holders</h2>
  <p>
    The bulk of U.S. federal debt is owned by domestic investors.  In
    October 2025 about two‑thirds of publicly held debt was held domestically
    (Federal Reserve, mutual funds, banks, households) and roughly one‑third
    was held by foreign investors【327875209348979†L110-L139】.  Japan and
    China were the largest foreign official holders【468197810869634†L4-L50】.
  </p>
  <h2>Invariants and Accounting Identities</h2>
  <p>
    Gross federal debt equals the sum of publicly held debt and
    intragovernmental holdings.  Debt is financed through Treasury auctions;
    the debt ceiling is a legal limit rather than an economic constraint.  The
    interest‑rate–growth differential (r − g) influences debt dynamics.  When
    r &lt; g, debt can decline relative to GDP even with moderate primary
    deficits; when r &gt; g, the opposite occurs.
