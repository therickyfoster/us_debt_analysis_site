  <h1>Phase 5 — Distributional &amp; Social Impact Audit</h1>
  <p>
    Debt management pathways have uneven impacts across income groups,
    generations and asset holders versus wage earners.  This phase audits
    those impacts and highlights invisible burdens.
  </p>
  <h2>Surprise Inflation &amp; Financial Repression</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Winners:</strong> Borrowers and younger households.  Unanticipated
      inflation reduces the real value of nominal claims, shifting wealth from
      lenders to borrowers【268262177527889†L8-L24】.  Younger cohorts benefit
      because they are net borrowers.</li>
    <li><strong>Losers:</strong> Older bondholders and savers.  Surprise inflation
      erodes fixed‑income assets and can produce persistent output losses
      【268262177527889†L16-L24】.</li>
    <li><strong>Delayed Burdens:</strong> Inflation undermines credibility and can
      lead to higher future borrowing costs if expectations become unanchored.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Austerity (Tax Increases &amp; Spending Cuts)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Winners:</strong> Bondholders and future taxpayers if debt is
      stabilized.  Lower debt can reduce interest costs.</li>
    <li><strong>Losers:</strong> Low‑income households and families with
      children.  A U.K. study found that austerity measures between 2010 and
      2014 led to the largest income losses for poor families with
      children, while pensioners were largely protected【316418912718641†L84-L102】.</li>
    <li><strong>Delayed Burdens:</strong> Cuts to education, infrastructure and
      social services can impede long‑term growth and social mobility.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Primary Surpluses &amp; Fiscal Consolidation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Winners:</strong> Future generations if surpluses reduce debt
      sustainably and fund productive investment.</li>
    <li><strong>Losers:</strong> Current taxpayers and beneficiaries who face
      higher taxes or reduced services.</li>
    <li><strong>Delayed Burdens:</strong> Regressive taxes or deep service cuts can
      widen inequality and erode social cohesion.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Debt Monetization &amp; Quantitative Easing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Winners:</strong> Asset holders and borrowers benefit from lower
      interest rates and rising asset prices.</li>
    <li><strong>Losers:</strong> Savers face lower returns; inequality may widen
      if asset prices outpace wages.</li>
    <li><strong>Invisible Burdens:</strong> Large central bank balance sheets
      expose taxpayers to interest‑rate risk; when rates rise, remittances to
      the Treasury decline.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Intergenerational and Social Impacts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Borrowing today benefits current generations at the expense of
      future generations by reducing national saving and crowding out
      investment【521263784822616†L72-L110】.</li>
    <li>High debt and repeated budget crises can erode trust in
      institutions.  Perceptions of unfair burden‑sharing fuel political
      polarization and diminish willingness to support collective solutions.</li>
