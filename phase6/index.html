  <h1>Phase 6 — Systemic &amp; Second‑Order Risk Analysis</h1>
  <p>
    This phase explores second‑ and third‑order effects of debt‑management
    strategies on global financial stability, the dollar’s reserve status,
    capital flows, political legitimacy and intergenerational trust.
  </p>
  <h2>Safe Asset Status &amp; Global Capital Flows</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The U.S. dollar accounts for about 58 % of global official foreign
      reserves and foreign investors hold roughly 32 % of marketable
      Treasuries【203841385617925†L645-L687】.  Near‑term challenges to this
      dominance appear limited【203841385617925†L1005-L1027】.</li>
    <li>Loss of safe‑asset status could raise long‑term interest rates and
      weaken the dollar.  Maintaining safe‑asset status may require
      fiscal discipline【518734610474351†L246-L270】.</li>
    <li>Reducing debt too aggressively could shrink the supply of safe
      assets, increasing the natural rate of interest and offsetting debt
      reduction.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Inflation, Financial Repression &amp; Trust</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Surprise inflation can erode debt but risks unanchoring
      expectations, leading to stagflation.</li>
    <li>Financial repression may succeed only when savers have limited
      alternatives and trust in institutions remains intact; otherwise
      capital may flee.</li>
    <li>Inflation that favours some groups over others can damage
      intergenerational trust and political legitimacy.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Reserve Currency Competition &amp; Geopolitical Tensions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>European fiscal integration could make the euro a more attractive
      reserve currency, but the market remains much smaller than U.S.
      Treasuries【203841385617925†L1030-L1043】.</li>
    <li>China’s renminbi is constrained by capital controls and low
      investor confidence【203841385617925†L1045-L1056】.</li>
    <li>Digital currencies and stablecoins could both challenge and
      reinforce dollar dominance; about 99 % of stablecoin market
      capitalization is dollar‑linked【203841385617925†L1061-L1067】.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Political Economy &amp; Social Cohesion</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>High debt can become a focal point for political polarization.
      Narrative lock‑in (e.g., austerity vs. stimulus) may lead to
      policy gridlock.</li>
    <li>Successful debt reduction that relies on deep spending cuts can
      erode public services, widening inequality and undermining social
      cohesion—a second‑order failure mode.</li>
  </ul>
