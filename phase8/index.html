  <h1>Phase 8 — Adversarial Red Team Review</h1>
  <p>
    The final phase stress‑tests each conditional pathway economically,
    politically and socially.  It also highlights divergence between public
    narratives and underlying realities.
  </p>
  <h2>Gradual Primary Surpluses</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Economic attack:</strong> If r &gt; g, even modest surpluses may not
      reduce the debt ratio.  Growth may underperform expectations.</li>
    <li><strong>Political attack:</strong> Sustained surpluses require
      bipartisan support; voters may reject prolonged austerity.</li>
    <li><strong>Social attack:</strong> Cuts can hurt vulnerable groups and
      provoke unrest.  Narratives may oversimplify austerity.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Managed Inflation &amp; Financial Repression</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Economic attack:</strong> Inflation can become entrenched,
      prompting wage‑price spirals and higher interest rates.</li>
    <li><strong>Political attack:</strong> Savers and retirees resist erosion of
      their wealth; central bank independence may be challenged.</li>
    <li><strong>Social attack:</strong> Inflation erodes trust and can fuel
      populist narratives that misallocate blame.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Perpetual Rollover under Safe‑Asset Demand</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Economic attack:</strong> Safe‑asset demand may weaken if
      alternatives emerge; manufacturing decline can hurt growth.</li>
    <li><strong>Political attack:</strong> Persistent trade deficits may
      generate backlash from regions hurt by deindustrialization; tariffs
      could reduce foreign demand for Treasuries【518734610474351†L203-L208】.</li>
    <li><strong>Social attack:</strong> Benefits accrue to asset holders and
      government finances, while workers may feel left behind.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Structural Growth‑First Strategy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Economic attack:</strong> Public investment may crowd out
      private investment if misallocated; returns are uncertain.</li>
    <li><strong>Political attack:</strong> Long gestation periods reduce
      political incentives; projects can be captured by interest groups.</li>
    <li><strong>Social attack:</strong> Unequal distribution of benefits can
      widen inequality and provoke backlash.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Debt Restructuring or Repudiation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Economic attack:</strong> Default would destroy safe‑asset
      status and trigger global financial turmoil.</li>
    <li><strong>Political attack:</strong> Repudiation could violate the
      U.S. Constitution and provoke crises.</li>
    <li><strong>Social attack:</strong> Pension funds and savers would suffer
      losses; trust in institutions would collapse.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="unresolved">Unresolved Questions</h2>
  <p>
    Several uncertainties remain:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Interest‑rate–growth differential:</strong> Future values of
      r − g are uncertain and depend on productivity, demographics and
      geopolitical shocks.</li>
    <li><strong>Distributional trade‑offs:</strong> Precise impacts depend on
      complex interactions among taxes, transfers, asset holdings and labour
      markets.  Data limitations and model sensitivity hinder precise
      projections.</li>
    <li><strong>Safe‑asset demand:</strong> While Treasuries remain dominant,
      alternative safe assets or geopolitical shifts could alter demand.</li>
    <li><strong>Political feasibility:</strong> Long‑term fiscal strategies
      require durable coalitions; U.S. politics is highly polarized.</li>
    <li><strong>Future shocks:</strong> Climate change, pandemics and wars could
      alter debt trajectories, necessitating further borrowing.</li>
  </ul>
