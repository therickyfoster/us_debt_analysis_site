  <h1>Phase 0 — Orchestration &amp; Guardrails</h1>
  <p>
    The analysis begins with a restatement of constraints and an
    acknowledgement of uncertainties.  No policy solutions are proposed at
    this stage.
  </p>
  <h2>Restating the Constraints</h2>
  <p>
    The project follows eight ordered phases.  Policy prescriptions are
    deferred until Phase 7.  Metaphors and analogies are treated as
    potentially hazardous because they can obscure causal mechanisms.  Every
    claim identifies what it explains, what it obscures and the evidence that
    could falsify it.  Accounting identities are separated from causal
    dynamics, and technical feasibility is distinguished from political
    feasibility.  Distributional impacts and second‑order effects are made
    explicit, and narrative lock‑in is avoided.
  </p>
  <h2>Known Unknowns and Uncertainties</h2>
  <p>
    Uncertainties include future macroeconomic paths (economic growth,
    inflation, interest rates), behavioural responses to policy, political
    reactions and the evolution of international capital flows.  While
    official datasets give reliable debt figures, the future trajectory of the
    interest‑rate–growth differential (r − g) and the resilience of the U.S.
    dollar’s safe‑asset status remain open questions.  Distributional and
    second‑order effects rely on models that are sensitive to assumptions.
  </p>
  <h2>No Solutions Yet</h2>
  <p>
    This phase explicitly confirms that the analysis refrains from proposing
    solutions.  Subsequent phases gather evidence and frame the problem; only
    in Phase 7 will conditional pathways be outlined, and even then they are
    not definitive prescriptions.
