  <h1>Phase 4 — Monetary &amp; Institutional Mechanics</h1>
  <p>
    This phase explains how the federal government issues and services debt,
    how the Federal Reserve interacts with the Treasury and distinguishes
    legal, political and technical constraints.  It also addresses common
    misconceptions.
  </p>
  <h2>Treasury Auctions and Debt Servicing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The U.S. Treasury sells marketable securities via auctions.
      In 2024 it held 440 public auctions and issued about
      \$28.5 trillion in bills, notes, bonds, TIPS and floating‑rate notes【595588385874898†L72-L81】.</li>
    <li>Auctions follow four steps: announcement, bidding, auction and
      issuance【595588385874898†L100-L110】.</li>
    <li>Debt servicing (coupon and principal payments) is funded through
      revenue and new issuance.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Federal Reserve Operations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Federal Reserve implements monetary policy by purchasing and
      selling securities.  Before the financial crisis, open market
      operations controlled reserves to steer the federal funds rate.  After
      2008 the Fed used large‑scale asset purchases (QE) to influence
      longer‑term rates【167221771344568†L608-L640】.</li>
    <li>The Fed also uses reverse repos and standing repo facilities to
      manage reserves.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Central Bank–Treasury Interaction</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Treasury issues debt; the Fed buys and sells Treasuries for
      monetary policy purposes.  Direct monetization is legally restricted
      but QE blurs lines.</li>
    <li>The debt ceiling is a political limit rather than an economic one.
      Government shutdowns and debt‑ceiling standoffs reflect political,
      not technical, constraints.</li>
    <li>The Fed remits profits to the Treasury, effectively lowering net
      interest costs.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>“The Fed prints money to pay for spending.”</strong>  The Fed
      creates reserves when it buys securities, but fiscal spending is
      financed through Treasury issuance.</li>
    <li><strong>“Borrowing automatically crowds out private investment.”</strong>
      Crowding out depends on economic slack; during downturns government
      borrowing can mobilize idle resources.  At full employment it may
      crowd out private investment【521263784822616†L100-L110】.</li>
    <li><strong>“Default risk is the main constraint.”</strong>  Inflation
      and loss of safe‑asset status are more relevant for sovereign currency
      issuers.</li>
    <li><strong>“Central bank independence is absolute.”</strong>  In crises,
      fiscal and monetary policies often coordinate, as seen during
      WWII and the pandemic.</li>
