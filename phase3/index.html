  <h1>Phase 3 — Historical &amp; Comparative Analysis</h1>
  <p>
    Historical and cross‑country experiences illuminate the mechanisms that
    reduce debt and reveal where analogies break down.  This phase contrasts
    the United States after World War II, the United Kingdom, Japan and
    emerging markets.
  </p>
  <h2>United States after World War II</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The U.S. debt‑to‑GDP ratio fell from about 106 % in 1946 to 23 % by
      1974.  Growth mattered, but surprise inflation and pegged interest
      rates played a major role【993446230725595†L35-L49】.
    </li>
    <li>
      Negative real interest rates were common; the BIS reports that
      liquidation (negative real rates) occurred in about half of the years
      between 1945 and 1980, averaging –3.5 %【361306165523109†L2358-L2366】.
    </li>
    <li>
      Post‑war financial repression included capital controls and
      regulations that limited competition for deposits, making it easier for
      the government to finance itself.
    </li>
    <li>
      These conditions are difficult to replicate today due to open
      capital markets and independent central banking.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>United Kingdom</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      After WWII the U.K. debt ratio exceeded 200 % of GDP but declined to
      roughly 65 % by 1970.  A Cambridge study finds that real growth
      played a larger role than inflation【854726174736267†L80-L90】.
    </li>
    <li>
      Growth was aided by a post‑war boom and rebuilding.  Tax revenues rose
      elastically with GDP, helping debt reduction【854726174736267†L80-L90】.
    </li>
    <li>
      Comparisons with the U.S. must account for different political
      institutions, empire‑to‑welfare state transitions and currency regimes.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Japan</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Japan’s government debt reached around 203 % of GDP in September 2025
     【852487383184818†L52-L70】, yet interest rates remain low because most
      debt is domestically held (88 %) and the Bank of Japan purchases
      government bonds【611385337102607†L124-L130】.
    </li>
    <li>
      Persistent low growth and deflation mean Japan has not “grown out” of
      its debt.  Sustainability relies on low rates and financial repression.
    </li>
    <li>
      Demographic headwinds and reliance on domestic investors limit
      applicability of the Japanese experience to the U.S.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Emerging Markets</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Many emerging economies face debt crises because they borrow in foreign
      currencies or rely on narrow domestic investor bases.  The IMF warns
      that overreliance on domestic banks and central bank financing can
      increase risk【266590356583766†L347-L366】.
    </li>
    <li>
      Countries with deep local investor bases and strong policy frameworks are
      more resilient.  U.S. debt, denominated in dollars and backed by
      institutional credibility, is not directly comparable to emerging
      markets, but lessons on investor diversity are useful.
    </li>
  </ul>
