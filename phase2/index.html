  <h1>Phase 2 — Frame Dissection</h1>
  <p>
    Dominant public and expert frames shape how the U.S. debt is understood.
    Each frame has strengths and blind spots.  This phase enumerates several
    common frames, identifies what they explain and what they obscure, and
    flags misleading metaphors.
  </p>
  <h2>Household Analogy</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Description</dt>
    <dd>Compares federal finances to a household budget and argues that
      government should “live within its means.”</dd>
    <dt>Explains</dt>
    <dd>Highlights the intuition that persistent borrowing incurs interest
      costs and may be unsustainable.</dd>
    <dt>Obscures</dt>
    <dd>Ignores that a government with a central bank operates the money
      system; spending cuts can reduce incomes and tax revenue.  The New
      Economics Foundation notes that austerity can paradoxically raise the
      debt‑to‑GDP ratio by shrinking the economy【504712807563203†L40-L99】.</dd>
    <dt>Falsifiable Evidence</dt>
    <dd>Countries with high public debt (e.g., Japan) borrow at low
      interest rates【852487383184818†L52-L70】, contrary to the idea that
      debt must be repaid like a household mortgage.</dd>
  </dl>
  <h2>“Debt is a Burden on Future Generations”</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Description</dt>
    <dd>Argues that today’s borrowing shifts the tax burden onto future
      generations.</dd>
    <dt>Explains</dt>
    <dd>Borrowing can transfer resources across time.  The Concord
      Coalition notes that borrowing benefits current generations while
      potentially reducing future capital accumulation【521263784822616†L72-L110】.</dd>
    <dt>Obscures</dt>
    <dd>When debt is held domestically, interest payments are transfers among
      citizens.  Growth and inflation can reduce the real burden without
      explicit repayment.</dd>
    <dt>Falsifiable Evidence</dt>
    <dd>The U.S. post‑WWII debt reduction occurred largely through growth
      and inflation rather than higher taxes【993446230725595†L35-L49】.</dd>
  </dl>
  <h2>“Growth Will Solve the Debt”</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Description</dt>
    <dd>Suggests that strong GDP growth alone can shrink the debt‑to‑GDP ratio.</dd>
    <dt>Explains</dt>
    <dd>Growth raises the denominator of the ratio and boosts tax revenues.</dd>
    <dt>Obscures</dt>
    <dd>The IMF shows that post‑WWII debt reduction relied heavily on
      inflation and interest‑rate suppression【993446230725595†L35-L49】;
      unrealistic growth assumptions can mislead【844846206395576†L273-L285】.</dd>
    <dt>Falsifiable Evidence</dt>
    <dd>Low‑growth, high‑debt countries (e.g., Japan) show that growth alone
      may not reduce debt.</dd>
  </dl>
  <h2>Safe Asset Status</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Description</dt>
    <dd>Views U.S. Treasuries as the world’s safe asset, providing a
      “convenience yield.”</dd>
    <dt>Explains</dt>
    <dd>Helps explain why the U.S. can issue large amounts of debt at low
      interest rates and run trade deficits.  A PIIE analysis notes that
      Treasuries yield below the global growth rate because of this
      service flow【518734610474351†L154-L166】.</dd>
    <dt>Obscures</dt>
    <dd>The strong dollar can harm U.S. manufacturing; safe‑asset status can
      encourage complacency【518734610474351†L193-L201】.</dd>
    <dt>Falsifiable Evidence</dt>
    <dd>A sudden loss of investor confidence would raise yields and test
      whether safe‑asset demand is durable.</dd>
  </dl>
  <h2>Modern Monetary Theory (Monetary Sovereignty)</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Description</dt>
    <dd>Argues that governments that issue their own currency can always
      finance deficits through money creation, constrained only by
      inflation.</dd>
    <dt>Explains</dt>
    <dd>Highlights that technical default is unnecessary for sovereign
      currency issuers.</dd>
    <dt>Obscures</dt>
    <dd>Downplays inflation risk, legal constraints (e.g., debt ceiling) and
      potential erosion of safe‑asset status.</dd>
    <dt>Falsifiable Evidence</dt>
    <dd>Hyperinflation episodes in emerging markets show that monetization can
      erode currency value; conversely, post‑2008 QE did not produce
      runaway inflation, illustrating context dependence.</dd>
